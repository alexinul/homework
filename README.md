## submitting homework

Send me an email with your archived code. Make sure you include a `build.sbt` file so that I can compile your code. It gets ridiculously tedious for 20+ people. You can also do a fork of this repo and push all your homework to github, or any other source-code repository. It's fine if it's publicly available.

## code of honour

Do not write code you yourself do not understand. It's perfectly fine to talk to your colleagues or consult outside sources. But copying code blindly will most likely be detected. You will be questioned about your code if any suspicion of misconduct arises.
